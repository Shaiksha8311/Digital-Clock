This project is a digital clock implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file (index.html) sets up the structure of the clock, defining three paragraphs with IDs for hours, minutes, and seconds. The CSS file (styles.css) provides styling to center the clock on the page, adjust colors, and create a border around it.

The JavaScript file (clock.js) contains the logic for updating the clock's display. It retrieves the current time using the Date object and updates the content of the hour, minute, and second paragraphs accordingly. The updateTime function is called repeatedly using setInterval to ensure that the clock display stays up to date in real-time.

Overall, this project demonstrates how to create a simple but functional digital clock using basic web development technologies. It's a great example for learning purposes and can serve as a foundation for further exploration and customization in web development projects
